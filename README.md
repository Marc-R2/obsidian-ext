Extensions and utilities regarding Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM) and the [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) ecosystem.

## Feature Highlights

-   [x] robust (tested, 100% coverage, fully typed)
-   [x] small (minimal dependencies)
-   [x] obsidian flavored markdown (Callouts, Tags, Wikilinks)
-   [x] json canvas (validate, parse, transform)

## When should I use this?

-   If you want to parse or transform Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM)
-   If you want to work with JSON Canvas
-   If you want to work with files from your Obsidian vault

## What is this?

This repository started out as simple extensions to [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark), [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) and [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) to support Obsidian Flavored Markdown (OFM).
I started this project because I was not satisfied with the existing solutions for parsing and transforming OFM.
Solutions like [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) did already support OFM, but I disliked their regex based approach.
While working on it, I also realized problems in the way Obsidian itself parses markdown (especially whitespaces in wikilinks) which lead me to create my own set of extensions to micromark and mdast.
After a short while I also wanted to work with the JSON Canvas format, so I added utilities for that as well.
