**J**SON **C**anvas **A**bstract **S**yntax **T**ree

## What is this?

**jcast** is a specification for representing [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org) in a [syntax tree](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#syntax-tree).
It implements [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist), a format for syntax trees, to benefit its [ecosystem of utilities](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#list-of-utilities).

## When to use this

In most cases you will not need to use this package directly.
It is used internally by [`jcast-util-from-json`](https://github.com/MoritzRS/obsidian-ext/tree/main/packages/jcast-util-from-json/) and [`jcast-util-to-json`](https://github.com/MoritzRS/obsidian-ext/tree/main/packages/jcast-util-to-json/) to convert between JSON Canvas and jcast.
